**Abstract**

The goal of this project is to predict the probability of travelers who have applied for a Claim that are eligible to receive the Claim. The project is done using Classification, Logistic Regression, and Hyperparameter Tuning. The project is mainly done in order to reduce the workload of the travel insurance company so that the Claim is properly received by the travelers who have correctly applied for the Claims, and not waste the Claims that are not claimed by the travelers or applied by the travelers who did not fill the application completely, and Claims applied by travelers who had submitted falsified or invalid applications.

**Project Features**
- Data Cleaning (Duplicate Values, Outliers, Invalid and Missing Values)
- Data Analysis
- Feature Selection and Engineering (Encoding and Scaling)
- Modeling, Analytics, and Evaluation (ROC-AUC, Logistic Regression, and Hyperparameter Tuning)
