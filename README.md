Abstract
The goal of this project is to predict the probability of travelers who have applied for a Claim that are eligible to receive the Claim. The project is done using Classification, Logistic Regression, and Hyperparameter Tuning. The project is mainly done in order to reduce the workload of the travel insurance company so that the Claim is properly received by the travelers who have correctly applied for the Claims, and not waste the Claims that are not claimed by the travelers or applied by the travelers who did not fill the application completely, and Claims applied by travelers who had submitted falsified or invalid applications.

Context
Travel insurance is a type of insurance that provides protection as long as we travel both domestically and abroad. Several countries have even required travelers to have travel insurance, for example, countries in Europe and America. The amount of premium depends on the coverage desired, the length of the trip, and the purpose of the trip. A company engaged in travel insurance wants to know the policyholder who will submit an insurance claim for coverage. Policyholder data at insurance companies is historical data consisting of destinations, insurance products, and so on.
